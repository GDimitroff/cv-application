## [CV Creator](https://cv-creator-f352b.web.app/)

A React app which allows users to create their own resume using a template and download it in a PDF format. This toy project is to enforce my learnings on React fundamentals (components and state management).

### Getting Started

In order to setup and work on this project on your own, you will need to:

1. Clone this project:  
   `git clone https://github.com/GDimitroff/cv-creator.git`

2. Once you have cloned this project, you can install the required dependencies by using:  
   `npm install`

3. A live demo of the project can be started by using:  
   `npm start`

4. Distribution files can be produced using:  
   `npm run build`

### Features

- Everything is **reactive**.
- The resume is **printable**.

### Outcome

- Used **useState** hook for basic **state management**.
- Used **context and reducer** for the global state of the app.
- Used **useForwardRef** hook for a specific case when I needed the child ref in the parent component.
- **Refactored** the whole thing at least 3 times.
- Tried to split components and follow the **DRY principle**.
- Tried to keep **file structure** as clean as possible.
- Tried to create a **stylish** and **minimalistic** look.
- Deepened knowledge of **rendering components**.
- Deepened knowledge of **props** and **event handlers**.
- Deepened knowledge of **state management**.
- Deepened knowledge of using **third party libraries**.
- Overall, I have **improved my learning abilities** A LOT! ðŸ§
